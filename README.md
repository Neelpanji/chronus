IDEA BEHIND THE PROJET/REASON FOR CHOOSING THIS AS OUR PROJECT IDEA OR CONCEPT.

In the world and specifically in our surroundings a lot of things keep happening some of which die before they become a news of interest and some are not at all considered a news by some agencies responsible for delivering news to common man ,and some news is so much highlighted, even though if it is not worthy to be of public interest.
All this info which is of various categories good,bad,interesting,entertaining,factual or general which is so presented as news comes to the common man as such, irrespective of categories/type.
The reciever of this info has to take it irrespective of his own mental health which often affects the mental health of reciever in negative way or in a way not intended(generally negative news ex corruption , criminal activities....).
it has been researched an dfound and is confirmed that all types of news have thier own impact for example.
Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety. Television coverage of the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, which repeated the same footage over and over, led to symptoms of trauma experienced across the United States. Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster. Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.
Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.
in order to improve their the quality of mental status of the user the news around the globe has been categorised and is delivered as per the mood and emotion of the user.
for instance a person with sad mood be given news of positivity in order to improve mental status, a person who is bored can be showed some interesting facts to change the mood status and person with a happy mood/normal mood be delivered with all general news of the day.
